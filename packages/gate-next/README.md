# ludion-ai/gate/next

The Ludion Gate for Next.js 16+, as a `proxy.js`. It verifies Web Bot Auth (RFC 9421) signatures, classifies automated traffic, and applies your Pressure policy. Humans are never affected.

## Install (60 seconds)

```sh
npm install ludion-ai
```

Create `proxy.js` in the project root. It is one line:

```js
export { proxy } from "ludion-ai/gate/next";
```

Put `ludion.config.json` next to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "site_id": "site-your-shop",
  "pressure": 0
}
```

Then `next build && next start` as usual. Pressure 0 only observes. Nothing changes for anyone until you raise it.

## Notes

- **Where it runs.** Next.js 16 runs `proxy.js` on the Node.js runtime, before routing, for every request, including `public/` files and `/_next/static`. The Gate classifies them all.
- **Key discovery stays off your network.** The Gate fetches an agent's public keys through a transport that resolves the name once, refuses every non-public address and connects to exactly the address it checked (the same one `@ludion/gate-node` uses). It never uses the runtime's plain `fetch`.
- **Signed bodies.** When an agent signs a request's `Content-Digest`, the Gate reads a clone of the body (up to 1 MiB) to check it. Your route handler still gets the whole body.
- **Config redirects bypass the Gate.** Redirects declared in `next.config.js` (`redirects()`) run *before* the proxy. The Gate never sees requests they answer.
- **Changed chunk names.** Adding the Gate renames a couple of content-hashed client chunks. The bundler numbers modules across the whole build, and the Gate adds server-only modules. The client code itself is the same; GATE-1 checks this chunk by chunk. Browsers download the renamed chunks once, as after any deploy.
- **Existing `proxy.js`.** If you already have one, call the Gate from it:

  ```js
  import { createNextGate } from "ludion-ai/gate/next";
  import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

  const gate = createNextGate({ next: () => NextResponse.next() });
  export async function proxy(request) {
    const res = await gate.proxy(request);
    if (res.headers.has("ludion-error")) return res; // denied by the Gate
    return yourProxy(request);
  }
  ```

## Configuration

The format of `ludion.config.json` is the same as for [`ludion-ai/gate/node`](../gate-node/README.md#configuration).

**Environment variables**

- **`LUDION_SITE_KEY`**: the Glass receipt key, as a secret.
- **`LUDION_CONFIG`**: a different config file path.
